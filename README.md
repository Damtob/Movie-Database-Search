# Movie-Database-Search:

**Movie Database Search Web App**: 
 This is a simple web application that allows users to search for movie details, including ratings and reviews, by integrating with a movie database API. The application is built using Python and Flask.

**Features**:

Search for movies by title.
Display movie details, including title, year, rating, plot, director, and actors.
Handle errors gracefully when no results are found or when there are issues with the API.
Prerequisites

**Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:**

Python 3.x
Flask
Requests
You will also need an API key from a movie database service. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key in the code.

**Installation**:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-database-search
Navigate to the project directory:
